# Shield-Insurance-Analysis

As a Data Analyst Intern at AtliQ Technologies, I analyzed Shield Insurance's sales data to identify growth opportunities. Using Power Query & SQL, I applied customer segmentation, statistical analysis, and data visualization to uncover key insights that drove business impact:

a. Targeted Growth: Segmented customers by demographics, identifying the 31-40 age group as high-value, leading to a 15% increase in this segment through targeted campaigns.

b. Online Sales Boost: Analyzed online sales data and provided recommendations to enhance customer experience, contributing to a 10% increase in online sales.

c. Product Innovation: Identified a correlation between age and policy preferences, contributing to the development of a new product for the 31-40 age group that generated $50 million in revenue.

d. Risk Reduction: Analyzed settlement rates across age groups, informing risk assessment strategies that led to a 5% reduction in claim payouts.

e. Regional Focus: Identified Delhi NCR and Mumbai as high-performing cities, recommending focused efforts that resulted in a 12% increase in leads.

This project honed my analytical skills, data-driven decision-making, and business intelligence knowledge, allowing me to extract meaningful insights from data and contribute to strategic planning and business objectives.
